    description: |
      A network groups together a set of stations and variables (see Variables).
      Typically a network is owned or managed by a single organization or entity,
      which often forms part of the network name.
  - name: Variables
    description: |
      A variable defines a physical quantity that is reported by one or more
      stations in a network. A variable is a memeber of a network and has
      zero or more observations associated with it.
  - name: Histories
    description: |
      A history defines a period in the lifetime of a single station,
      giving its name, location, frequency of reporting, and variables reported,
      and specifying the period of time for which this is true.
  - name: Stations
    description: |
      A station represents a source of observations, usually but not necessarily
      an electromechanical system for measuring environmental variables.
      A station has one or more histories that define its working lifetime.
  - name: Observations
    description: |
      An observation is a single datum reported by a station for a particular
      variable.
