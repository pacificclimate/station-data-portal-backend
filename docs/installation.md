# Installation

To clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pacificclimate/station-data-portal-backend
```

It is best practice to install using a virtual environment.
We use [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
to manage dependencies and create a virtual environment.

To install the project dependencies:

```bash
$ pipenv install # Or
$ pipenv install --dev # to include development packages
```

To install the project proper:

```bash
$ pipenv install -e .
```
